# **Epitech-libproject**

### What is the Epitech lib project ?
The Epitech lib project consists on making a library regrouping all the source files used on the C Pool of Epitech
### What is the goal of this project ?
Well, having too many source codes can be seen as messy on a repository so we implemented the code into a single library. Each time i call a function, i don't have to put more code on another source code and so on...
### Can i use your code ?
Sure but think wisely before taking it. If you are an Epitech student like me, then you can make your own code (and use my code ONLY as an example). Just do not copy if you don't know how the code itself works.
